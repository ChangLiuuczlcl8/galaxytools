## Developer instructions

When updating this tool, it is necessary to make sure 
that `job_options` in `macros.xml` config file are up-to-date.
This can be done by running `galaxy/generate_options.py` script in
[MSMetaEnhancer](https://github.com/RECETOX/MSMetaEnhancer) tool and 
copying generated options to the macro.
