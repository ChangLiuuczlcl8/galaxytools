  spec2vec_similarity:
    description: "Mass spectra similarity scoring using a trained Spec2Vec model."
    long_description: |
      "Spec2Vec is a novel spectral similarity score inspired by a natural language processing algorithmâ€”Word2Vec.
      Spec2Vec learns frag- mental relationships within a large set of spectral data to derive abstract spectral 
      embeddings that can be used to assess spectral similarities."
